# Digital Footprint

Digital Footprint is a Chrome extension that calculates and displays to users the CO2 emissions associated with their Internet usage. It was created with the intent of promoting sustainable digital practices and drawing awareness to a major source of GHG emissions. According to the BBC in 2020, "the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet, and the systems supporting them account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions," an amount which equals the carbon emissions generated by the entire aviation industry. Alarmingly, this figure is predicted to double by 2025.
